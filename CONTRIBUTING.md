# Contributing to Mixite

If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.
When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable
as possible.

Mixite is coded in Kotlin which [supports multiple runtimes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html) (web,
jvm, android etc). Mixite is agnostic so only uses Kotlin common code (which runs equivalently on all targets)
