# Hexameter

Hexameter is a hexagonal grid library. The motivation behind it is to have
an optimized, simple and usable library for drawing hexagonal grids without
being tied to any GUI framework. So it works on Android, SWT, Swing, you
name it!

 - Rectangular
 - Rhombus
 - Custom

## Supported operations
 - Getting a hexagon by its grid coordinate
 - Getting a hexagon by its pixel coordinate
 - Getting the neighbors of a hexagon

 - Checking whether a Hexagon is on a grid or not 
 - Supplying a custom storage object 
 - Adding custom data to a Hexagon
 - Clearing all custom data from the HexagonalGrid
